        <p class="lead"> During my time at university, I was actively involved in several clubs and leadership roles. As a Research Member of the AI Research Lab, I conducted research on applying deep learning models to healthcare, publishing papers and presenting at conferences. I led a team in multiple hackathons, securing top finishes with innovative machine learning solutions. As Project Lead of the Robotics Club, I spearheaded the development of autonomous robots for competitions. As Vice President of the IEEE Student Chapter, I organized workshops and events. Additionally, I served as a Teaching Assistant, mentoring students in machine learning and data structures. </p>
