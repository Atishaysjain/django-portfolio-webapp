            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>I’m James Powell, and my passion for technology and innovation has been the driving force behind my academic and professional journey. Currently, I’m pursuing a PhD in Artificial Intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where I am diving deep into the intricacies of machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. The intersection of AI with real-world applications excites me, particularly how it can be harnessed to solve complex problems, whether it's in healthcare, finance, or climate science.</p>

                <p>My background in technology started during my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. It was here that I first encountered the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The hands-on experience I gained, whether it was designing autonomous robots or creating blockchain auditing tools, solidified my desire to work at the forefront of technological innovation.</p>

                <p>After Berkeley, I pursued a Master’s in Computer Science at San Jose State University, where I was deeply involved in AI-focused hackathons, research, and teaching. My professional experience has spanned internships at Google, Facebook, Apple, and Tesla, where I’ve worked on optimizing system performance, developing machine learning models, and automating internal tools for manufacturing processes.</p>

                <p>Looking ahead, my career goals center around pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning to solve real-world problems while addressing ethical considerations. I aspire to lead teams working on AI-driven innovations in healthcare, climate science, and beyond.</p>
